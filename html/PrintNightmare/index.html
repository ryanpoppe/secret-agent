            <p><strong>INFILTRATION SUCCESSFUL</strong></p>
            <p>You've identified the vulnerability that exposed the fatal weakness of centralized print servers.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>In June 2021, a critical remote code execution vulnerability was discovered in the Windows Print Spooler service. This vulnerability, which became known as <span class="highlight">PrintNightmare</span>, allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on domain controllers and other Windows systems running the Print Spooler service.</p>
        
        <p>The impact was devastating. Organizations worldwide scrambled to patch their systems, disable print services, or implement workarounds. Many couldn't patch fast enough. The vulnerability proved what security experts had warned about for years: <strong>centralized print servers are ghosts haunting your network</strong>, invisible until they strike.</p>
        
        <p>But here's the remarkable part: <strong>Vasion customers were unaffected.</strong></p>
        
        <p>Why? Because Vasion's serverless printing infrastructure doesn't rely on Windows Print Spooler services or centralized print servers. There was no vulnerable attack surface. No emergency patches. No scrambling to disable critical services. Just continuous, secure printing operations.</p>
        
        <p>This is the power of eliminating the print server entirely. You can't exploit what doesn't exist.</p>
        
        <div class="next-directive">
            <h3>Phase 4: The Replacement Protocol</h3>
            <p><strong>NEXT OBJECTIVE:</strong> Now that you understand the threat, you must identify the solution. Vasion Print eliminates print servers by implementing a modern architecture that combines a centralized management console with direct client-to-printer connections.</p>
            
            <p><strong>HINT:</strong> Look for the three core acronyms hidden in the description of this superior infrastructure model. The acrostic pattern reveals: <strong>S</strong>ecurity, <strong>P</strong>erformance, <strong>I</strong>nfrastructure. The path is the resulting acronym.</p>
